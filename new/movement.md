# Movement

Every turn, a character may move up to their move speed to an unnoccupied tile -
a movement speed of one allows you to move one tile. If a tile is threatened by
another character, you must use twice as much movement per tile. This applies
when entering or leaving a threatened tile. If you have one remaining tile of
movement, you may still enter or leave a threatened tile.

# Threatened Tiles

A non-vulnerable character threatens every tile directly adjacent to them,
including diagonals.
