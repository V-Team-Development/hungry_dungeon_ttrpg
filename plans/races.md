Octopi girls

Kiwi bird harpy with eggs as big as them

Demon race that has a unique digestion mechanic. Instead of satiation restoring
as they absorb digested food, it's restored when digest buildup increases on
living prey, with regular food doing nearly nothing. They can't buy either of
the satiation restoration perks (omnivore and nihilivore). When I eventually add
the mind health system (sanity?), reducing that would work better.

Spiders eat by spitting digestive juices onto prey, right? Arachne should be
able to increase digest buildup on enemies with an attack. This should also
disable natural buildup recovery.

Vampire race. Can't digest food at all (will still absorb liquids since those
can't be spit out, though no SAT is gained), instead restores SAT by draining it
from prey. Can also drain from things outside of her, but less easily. When
their SAT is gone, she drains additional hp on top of the normal digestion
damage. Not 100% efficient in SAT drain, would be OP otherwise. Probably little
to no natural regen, can't take the regen perks. Pairs well with prey players.

Let some organs have higher vore power.

Eldrich horror creature that can't eat directly, instead spawning lesser
creatures who digest for her. Get as Geiger as possible.

mushroomgirl race, spread spores that infect enemies and make debuffs. Get
everyone high to do poise DOT.
