To start, a player must raise the Horny meter of an enemy by doing various lewd
things (belly rub, grope, etc). When this is high enough, players will be able
to perform sex actions. These reduce the Sanity of an enemy, making them more
vulnerable to mental manipulation.

For those uninterested, an Asexual toggle disables being horny.

Some spells might require you to be a certain level of horny, or scale with
horny. This might also apply to sanity.
