Doubled Digestion: lend an ally the strength of your belly, adding your own
digestion damage to theirs.

A cultist or haunted perk where an NPC in your head randomly tells you to do
things, and obeying them provides bonuses.

Expend a life for a boost to will and energy regen for a few turns. Rock Lee
reference? Call it "the eight gates".

Spell that makes a pred's past meals haunt them as their fat, jiggling
themselves to reduce poise. Only works on pred characters.

two stuffed preds can crush/press their bellies together? Like a crush but
different somehow, mostly for the flavor

Ability to funnel xp gained into xp orbs that grow inside a womb, then birth
them to allow others to eat them and gain the xp.

When flying, your agility is increased, but your carry weight drops drastically.
Maybe you take more poise damage when hit.

Damage an organ from outside, to help allies escape?

To finish some ideas, I need the ability to intercept and modify the digestion
damage calculation.

Demon Flips the Cart: massive SAT consumption, big strength boost. If you run
out of SAT, your energy keeps regenerating, but consumes hp instead.

A slimegirl should have the option to just fling herself at an enemy to grapple
them via engulfment. If it fails, does lots of poise damage.

Harpy with an egg can drop it onto the head of a target. Destroys the egg but
does lots of damage. Maybe makes them easier to eat or more appealing.
