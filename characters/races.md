## Carry Weight

Every character has a carry weight, determines how much they can carry
comfortably. To calculate your carry weight, multiply your strength stat by 10.

If the weight of all the stuff you're carrying - either inside or outside of
yourself - exceeds this carry weight, your speed drops by 1 and your dodge
modifier drops by 2. If the total is double your carry weight, those penalties
are doubled, and this continues until both of these are zero and you become
immobile.

An unburdened race gains a bonus to their carry weight equal to half of their
size.

## Human

A good all-rounder, humans have no special features but high versitility.
