# Talents

By spending talent points, earned each level, you can unlock or upgrade talents,
adding new options to your character. A talent can be upgraded if it has an "on
upgrade" line.

## Satiation Talents

Some talents have a major effect on your source of satiation. Satiation is a
very important resource, and aligning your best source of it with your desired
playstyle is key to enjoying your game. For any talent marked as "satiation
talent", you may choose one when creating a character without spending a talent
point. At any time, you may select a new satiation talent; this does not consume
a talent point, but does replace your previous satiation talent.

## Active and Passive

A talent may add a passive effect, which is always active and does not require
input, or enable an action. The type of action (Action, Quick Action, Internal
Action, or Free Action) is specified, and the energy cost is listed in
parentheses.

## List of Talents

### Accelerated Healing

Speed up healing of allies in your womb.

Quick Action (0): your passive womb healing runs again this turn.

Passive: womb healing increases by 10%, while satiation cost is unchanged.

On Upgrade: healing increases by an additional 10%.

### Aetherbolt

A lance of magical energy.

Action: {description}

### Aetherial Digestion

Channel your magic to increase the power of your organs.

Internal Action (20): for the next 5 turns, use your sorcery instead of durability
when determining digestion damage.

Requirements: 14 sorcery.

### Big Eater

Despite being tiny, your stomach has the capacity of something much larger.

Passive: your racial organ capacities are treated as 5 times higher than they
are, including for maximum capacity upgrades.

Requirements: be size 20 or smaller.

### Crush

Squeeze your muscles tight, damaging everything inside you.

Internal Action (20): Squeeze one of your organs tight, dealing your strength modifier as
blunt damage to anything inside.

### Egg Layer

Adds the ability to produce eggs.

Free Action (0): choose to begin gestating an egg. This egg will grow over 10
turns (variable, depends on race) while draining {sat} satiation. If your
satiation is below this, the egg will not grow that turn. Once fully grown, the
egg may be expelled as with any object. Digesting the egg is worth {sat} food.

Requiremets: be an egg-laying race, such as Harpy, Lamia, or Arachne. Bunnygirls
may also unlock this if easter is observed.

Give your energy to an ally.

Quick Action (20): Give 20 energy to another character.

### Featherweight

Magically increases your carry capacity.

Action (30): Cast a featherweight effect on a target of your choosing. This
target gains 20 carry weight multiplied by your spellcasting modifier for 10
turns.

On Upgrade: Increase carry weight per modifier (base is 20) by 5.

### Futa

Passive: your character has a penis. This behaves as described in the "special
organs" section of the rulebook.

### Gutslut

Being digested invigorates you.

### Mama's Hungry

While rebirthing other players, your digestion power is increased.

Passive: while your womb contains at least one regressed or rebirthed player, or
other entity catagorized as "child" (eggs do not count), your digestion power is
increased by one. This effect only activates while the child is draining
satiation.

rulebook.

### Wild Flurry

A reckless series of attacks, gaining in strength each strike while leaving you
vulnerable.

Action (10): make a normal attack, while gaining 1 stack of the Wild Flurry
status. Each stack of this decreases your dodge modifier by 1, while adding 1 to
the modifier of the next wild flurry. This effect expires in two turns,
refreshing the duration every time a stack is gained.
