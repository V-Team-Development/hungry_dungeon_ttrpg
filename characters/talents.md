# Talents

By spending talent points, earned each level, you can unlock or upgrade talents,
adding new options to your character. A talent can be upgraded if it has an "on
upgrade" line.

## Satiation Talents

Some talents have a major effect on your source of satiation. Satiation is a
very important resource, and aligning your best source of it with your desired
playstyle is key to enjoying your game. For any talent marked as "satiation
talent", you may choose one when creating a character without spending a talent
point. At any time, you may select a new satiation talent; this does not consume
a talent point, but does replace your previous satiation talent.

## Active and Passive

A talent may add a passive effect, which is always active and does not require
input, unlock an [Action], or both.
