# Skill Points and Stat Points

Every level, you'll gain a skill point, which can be used to unlock a new skill
or upgrade an existing skill. Every five levels, you'll gain a stat point, which
can upgrade any of your stats by one. In addition, every level comes with a five
percent health boost, rounded up. This boost is relative to your race's starting
health - you gain the same bonus every level.

## Capacity Training

Your organs all have a base capacity, but stretching them repeatedly allows that
capacity to increase, letting you comfortably hold more inside you. This will
eventually reach a cap - to go beyond this cap, you'll need to spend a skill
point.
