# Weight Gain

Weight gain is an optional feature for those who enjoy it, a way for their meals
to show themselves visibly. Normally, satiation over the maximum slowly fades
over time; when weight gain is enabled, that excess instead becomes fat. There
are many places on a character that have the option to gain weight, and the
player may choose how much goes to each. Generally, fat can go to the
character's overall body, their breasts, or their butt.

There are two types of fat, which are visually identical but behave differently.
99% of satiation goes to short-term fat, which builds up quickly, but this fat
also is burned when satiation is below max to restore it. 1% goes to long-term
fat, which is never lost outside of things targeting it specifically.

The amount of fat gained is based on the character's nutritional density, the
amount of satiation a character is worth per unit of size. The conversion to fat
isn't perfect, however, and only 10% of lost satiation can be captured as fat.
