# Egg Layer

Adds the ability to produce eggs.

At any time, you may choose to begin gestating an egg. This egg will grow over
10 turns (variable, depends on race) while draining {sat} satiation. If your
satiation is below this, the egg will not grow that turn. Once fully grown, the
egg may be expelled as with any object. Digesting the egg is worth {sat} food.

Requiremets: be an egg-laying race, such as Harpy, Lamia, or Arachne. Bunnygirls
may also unlock this if easter is observed.
