# Regression

When a player upgrades a stat, unlocks or upgrades a perk, or otherwise advances
their character, those choices cannot be changed at will. However, with the aid
of another character, your character may undergo age regression and then
progression, resetting their character while keeping their level, allowing them
to unlock different upgrades. Optionally, this may also change their race to
match that of their new mother. This does not preserve organ capacity training
or other upgrades not tied to level.
