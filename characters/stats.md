# Stats

Every character has these six "ability" stats: Instinct, Agility, Strength,
Durability, Charisma, and Sorcery. Your level in these stats is used for almost
everything.

Every character also has other stats, listed below.

## Health

Health is a character's ability to continue fighting. Taking damage will reduce
this. If your health hits zero, you are considered incapacitated. While in this
state, you cannot take actions or contest rolls. You remain in this state until
your health is restored to 20% of its maximum.

## Satiation

Satiation is primarily used to restore energy, but is also used to generate
resources (milk, eggs, etc), rebirth players, and so on. All characters
passively recover satiation over time, depending on their race and perks, but
restoration comes primarily from eating food.

Satiation has three sub-stats, mostly determined by race:

### Maximum satiation

When satiation is at or above this amount, passive regen will no longer
activate, and a percentage of satiation over the maximum will be lost every
turn.

### Passive satiation regeneration

At the start of every turn, a character will recover this much satiation, even
without eating food.

### Digestion efficiency

Determines how much absorbed food is converted into satiation. Ranges from 0% to
100%.
