# Stats

Every character has these stats.

## Health

Health is a character's ability to continue fighting. Taking damage will reduce
this. If your health hits zero, you are considered incapacitated. While in this
state, you cannot take actions or contest rolls. You remain in this state until
your health is restored to 20% of its maximum.

## Instinct

## Agility

## Strength

## Durability

## Charisma

## Sorcery

## Satiation

Satiation is primarily used to restore energy, but is also used to generate
resources (milk, eggs, etc), rebirth players, and so on. All characters
passively recover satiation over time, depending on their race and perks, but
restoration comes primarily from eating food.
