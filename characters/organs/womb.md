# Womb

Wombs cannot digest prey, but have access to a variety of protective and
supportive abilities.

## Healing

If allies are present in your womb, it will attempt to consume satiation to heal
them. 1 satiation is used per 10 hp healed.

## Rebirth

If a ghost occupies a womb, the character may choose to rebirth that ghost as a
living character again. This occurs over 10 turns, requiring satiation equal to
what that character would provide if eaten.
