# Character Creation

## Choosing a Race

To start, pick a race to play as.

Every character starts off with an 8 in all stats, though some races have
bonuses to specific stats. Every race also starts with some number of stat
points, which can be freely allocated to boost any stat by 1. Races with more
powerful inherent abilities (see below) have fewer starting stat points.

Below is list of the features that might influence your choice of race.

### Organs

Most races have the basic humanoid organs, but some, like the Centaur and
Slimegirl, have a different layout. The Centaur has two stomachs, one for her
human half and one for her horse half, while the semi-liquid Slimegirl only has
one organ which can freely choose who and what to digest.

### Starting Perks and Abilities

Usually, unlocking a perk or ability requires you to spend a skill point.
However, some races have perks or abilities unlocked for free. For example, a
Lamia starts with the Crush ability, and Cowgirls all get the Milky perk.

### Racial Features

Some races have skills only they can use or unlock. These provide unique
gameplay opportunities you can't get elsewhere. For example, slimegirls have an
acidification system, where their own buildup levels add bonuses to some of
their abilities.

## Assigning Points

Once you've picked a race, you may assign that race's starting stat points and
skill points as you choose. Try to keep your playstyle in mind - if you intend
to do a lot of vore, you'll want strength and durability, as well as
vore-related abilities. A magic-focused build will want sorcery and instinct,
and a harrier will work better with lots of agility. Some skills have
requirements to unlock them, such as a character level or stat level, so you
might want to save a few points if there's something specific you have your eye
on.
