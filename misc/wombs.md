# Wombs

Wombs cannot digest prey, but have access to a variety of protective and
supportive abilities.

Every turn, players inside the womb of a friendly character will recover up to
10% of the womb owner's max hp. This drains satiation from the host, and the
heal amount will be smaller if not enough satiation is available.

If a ghost occupies a womb, the character may choose to rebirth that ghost as a
living character again. This occurs over several turns, draining satiation, and
having more satiation available increases speed.
