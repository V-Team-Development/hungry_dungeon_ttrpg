# Combat

## Health

If your health hits zero, you are considered incapacitated. While in this state,
you cannot take actions or contest rolls. You remain in this state until your
health is restored to 20% of its maximum.

## Poise

Every character has a poise value, which represents how steady on their feet
they are. When poise hits zero, a character will be staggered, which marks them
as vulnerable for two turns. Once this period ends, their poise will reset to
its maximum.
