# Combat

Combat takes place over a series of rounds, each of which is anywhere from 30 to
90 seconds. Within each round, players may take their turns in any order, while
NPCs usually act at the end of a round.

## Order of Events

Events take place in the following order every round:

1. Energy and Actions recover for all characters
2. Players take actions
3. NPCs take actions
4. Status effects per-turn effect activates
5. Digestion occurs

## Actions

Once every round, a character may perform one action and one quick action, or
two quick actions. They may also perform one internal action and as many free
actions as they choose.

## Energy

Energy is consumed for almost every action a character can take. All characters
recover 10 energy per turn, up to the maximum of 100; if they have any
satiation, up to 10 will be consumed to restore an equal amount of energy. In
most cases, characters will recover 20 energy per turn.

If a character's satiation exceeds their maximum, an additional 10 will be
converted to energy, for a total of 30 energy recovered that turn.

## Poise

Every character has a poise value, which represents how steady on their feet
they are. When poise hits zero, a character will be staggered, which marks them
as vulnerable for two turns. Once this period ends, their poise will reset to
its maximum.
