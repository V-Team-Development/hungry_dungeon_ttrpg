# Combat

Combat takes place over a series of rounds, each of which is anywhere from 30 to
90 seconds. Within each round, players may take their turns in any order, while
NPCs usually act at the end of a round.

## Willpower

Willpower represents the actions a character can take. Every character recovers
15 willpower per round, up to a maximum of 30; this allows actions to be saved
across turns, enabling bursts of activity at the cost of doing nothing the
previous turn. Most actions consume willpower, and fall into three categories:
full, quick, and free. A full action consumes 10 willpower, a quick action
consumes 5, and a free action consumes none.

## Energy

Energy is consumed for almost every action a character can take. All characters
recover 10 energy per turn, up to the maximum of 100; if they have any
satiation, up to 10 will be consumed to restore an equal amount of energy. In
most cases, characters will recover 20 energy per turn.

If a character's satiation exceeds their maximum, an additional 10 will be
converted to energy, for a total of 30 energy recovered that turn.

## Poise

Every character has a poise value, which represents how steady on their feet
they are. When poise hits zero, a character will be staggered, which marks them
as vulnerable for two turns. Once this period ends, their poise will reset to
its maximum.
