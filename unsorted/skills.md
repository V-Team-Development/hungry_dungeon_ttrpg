# Skills

A skill is your ability to do a specific action. Every skill has a primary stat,
which determines its modifier (see below), and it may have a secondary stat as
well. When rolling for a skill, add together the primary and secondary stats, as
well as your skill bonus.

## Rolls

When asked for a roll, take as many D6 dice as is specified - usually, it's your
skill level - and roll them. Every 5 or 6 is a success, and the total number of
successes is the result of your roll.

In some cases, you may be given the "critical dice" modifier. When this is
active, rolling a 6 allows you to re-roll that die, adding another success to
your total if that die is a 5 or 6. If it's a 6, you can re-roll it again,
continuing until you do not roll a 6.

The "lucky dice" modifier is similar, but in reverse - if you roll a 1, you may
re-roll that die, continuing to re-roll it until you do not roll a 1.

Both of these mechanics may be referred to by other names, such as "critical
hit", but "critical" and "lucky" will always be present.

## Skill Modifier

Some mechanics use modifiers, rather than rolls. In almost all cases, this
modifier equals half of the skill's primary stat (rounded down) plus your level
for the relevant skill. For example, the primary stat for the dodge skill is
agility, so a character with 12 agility has a dodge modifier of 6. As a
character's dodge modifier determines their poise regen, they would recover 6
poise per turn, before other effects come into play.

## Skill Bonus

Your skill bonus represents additional mastery of the skill. Each bonus point
adds one die to skill rolls and one point to your skill modifier.

## Above, but in Fewer Words

- Stat level: just what it is
- Skill level: primary stat plus optional secondary stat plus skill bonus
- Skill modifier: half your primary stat, rounded down, plus skill bonus
- Skill bonus: added to both modifier and rolls

## Contested Rolls

In a contested roll, two characters both roll a skill, and whoever has the
highest roll wins the contest. In the case of the tie, the defender wins. The
amount the winner's roll exceeds the loser's roll is the degree of success; this
value is often used for bonuses.

A target may not contest a roll under certain circumstances, either by choice or
by force - for example, a knocked out or sleeping character can't roll dodge. In
this case, they're treated as having rolled a zero.
