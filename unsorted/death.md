## Death

A character can die in two ways: by being digested or by taking lethal damage
after being knocked out. Any prey the character had inside them moves to the
location the character was in.

If the dead character is a player, a ghost is created. This ghost cannot be
interacted with (usually), takes up no space, and can freely enter and exit
character's organs, even those without a direct connection to the outside. A
ghost cannot bypass physical barriers aside from these.

## Respawning

When a player is a ghost, they will usually need to respawn in order to continue
playing. This can be done in a number of ways.

Players can freely respawn at their last visited safe zone.

Every character has three lives, which can be used to instantly respawn with
full health and satiation. A player respawns whereever their ghost is, assuming
that location has room to hold them - if it doesn't, the respawn fails. Players
recover one life every thirty minutes, up to the maximum of three. After using a
life to respawn, a player must wait five minutes to use another. Other methods
of respawning do not share this cooldown.

A friendly player can respawn a character inside their womb without using a
life; however, this process is not instant and consumes satiation.

If a player is knocked out, but not dead, they may expend a life to instantly
recover as if respawning.
