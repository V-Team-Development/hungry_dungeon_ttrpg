# Playstyles

Creating a character can be overwhelming at first - the descriptions tell you
what skills do, but not when and why you would want them. This section is meant
as a set of ideas to guide your character builds, which can be deviated from
whenever you feel ready. There's no rule saying you have to pick just one,
either - for example, harriers and dodge tanks both use agility, so you can
easily be both at once. Mix and match to your heart's content.

## The Bruiser

A bruiser has one goal: deal damage. Lowering an enemy's health to zero almost
always takes them out of the fight, and it's the most straightforward way to win
encounters.

To make a Bruiser, put stat points first into strength and then agility, and
purchase damage skills such as {skills}.

## The Harrier

A Harrier has a similar job to a Bruiser, but their goal is to do poise damage
instead, unbalancing enemies to open them up to powerful attacks.

To make a Harrier, prioritize Agility, then add some strength and instinct.

## The Tank

A Tank's job is to soak up damage to protect their party, keeping them alive
while they work. There are two main styles of tank: health tanks, which rely on
surviving damage, and dodge tanks, which try to avoid damage entirely.

To make a Tank, choose a race with high health, then spend points on either
durability (for health tanks) or instinct and agility (for dodge tanks). Unlock
the guard ability to complete the set.

## The Glutton

This is a vore game, after all, and some people want to use that. A glutton
devours enemies, taking them out of the fight while trying to finish them off in
their stomach (or other organ).

To play a glutton, pick a race with bonuses to vore, then prioritize strength
and durability, and buy vore-related skills. You also might want to save a few
skill points for organ capacity upgrades.

## The Mage
