# Respawning

When a character dies, rather than simply being knocked out, they will need to
respawn in order to continue playing. This can be done in a number of ways.

In the online game, players can freely respawn at their last visited safe zone.

Every character has three lives, which can be used to instantly respawn with
full health and satiation.

A friendly player can respawn a character inside their womb without using a
life; however, this process is not instant and consumes satiation.

If a player is knocked out, but not dead, they may expend a life to instantly
recover as if respawning.
