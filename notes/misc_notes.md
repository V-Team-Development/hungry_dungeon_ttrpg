Allow a perk that lowers the sat cost of respawning/birthing players.

Have players respawn with only 20% health and sat and no will, to make womb
respawns more competitive.

My main challenge is that I have to cater to a wide variety of interests. I
can't assume that everyone wants to be pred, or prey, or be pregnant, or gain
weight, or anything else. I have to balance everything as optional.
