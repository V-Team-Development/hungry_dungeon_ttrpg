Allow a perk that lowers the sat cost of respawning/birthing players.

Have players respawn with only 20% health and sat and no will, to make womb
respawns more competitive.

My main challenge is that I have to cater to a wide variety of interests. I
can't assume that everyone wants to be pred, or prey, or be pregnant, or gain
weight, or anything else. I have to balance everything as optional.

Need a good way to specify what happens when you attack different targets.
Organs and characters can both be hit, but organs use body to contest and
indigestion goes up, while characters use dodge to resist and poise goes down.

Rather than a smooth curve, the speed/dodge penalty should be distinct stages.
To simplify the carry weight calculations, the character's body should not be
included aside from extreme situations, such as breasts bigger than body size.
Up to your carry weight (usually around 2x size) no penalty, then every
multiplier over that gives some noticable penalty. I'll have it as a status
effect to make it obvious what's happening.

A "piercing" system to reduce damage taken by people inside you?

"Sneaky" attacks that alert enemies but don't raise aggro? Or it only raises
aggro if there's no other players nearby.

Add a "fast mode" setting that instantly ends a round if all players have taken
their turns and everyone has fast mode enabled.

If only one player exists, the round timer doesn't tick.

Food absorption,

Allow egg layers to lay respawn eggs, which they can respawn inside of for free.
Might also allow players to gestate clones of themselves, which they can occupy
to recover.
