There's a specific "free" state, name in progress, which is required for some
actions and gives bonuses to many others. This state means not devoured, not
grappled, and not otherwise restricted in movement.

If you are held by someone, non-ranged attacks can only be used on them. A
grapple or devour attempt is non-ranged.

What actual advantages does a grab have? Do I even need it? It's a lot of design
work for uncertain benefits. I'll have to plan out exactly what it does soon.

A grabbed character cannot move, and that's it?

Grab should do something for vore - maybe even be required.

For now, ignore it, then come back later.

The initial devour doubled as a swallow.

A swallow uses your orifice size compared to the size of the prey. It also uses
rolls, somehow.

Rather than a modifier per roll, it's just ratios? Two physical rolls contest.
On a success, the pred swallows the prey deeper. On a failure, it doesn't. If
the hits are over twice the prey hits, it swallows twice. Two swallows is the
limit, it doesn't get higher than that. Crit ratio might be triple instead.

The orafice has a capacity, and will attempt to force that much into itself
every swallow, and anything already in it will be forced out of it. A successful
swallow will pull in that much, a successful escape will pull out that much.
