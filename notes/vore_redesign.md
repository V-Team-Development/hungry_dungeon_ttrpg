Each organ has its own capacity, but each orifice (connecting two organs or
leading outside) has a capacity of its own. The capacity of an orifice
determines how big of an object you can swallow. Some objects have a multiplier
on their effective size for this purpose - for example, the long-tailed lamia
has a large size, but doesn't need to be swallowed lengthwise. The maximum size
of what you can swallow and how much size you swallow per swallow are not the
same thing.

A pred can make additional swallow attempts on new prey, or a character can try
to feed themselves to a pred already swallowing something, or an
already-swallowed prey can attempt to escape, as long as the new total size
doesn't exceed the maximum size of the orifice. If it does, everything already
inside the orifice will be pushed further in or out, depending on the direction
of the attempted new addition.

When multiple prey are inside an orifice, the pred must make swallow checks
against each of them, and the swallow fails if any of them pass the check. The
total swallowed size is divided evenly among all prey. Alternate: each failed
check reduces the amount of swallowed size proportionally to the size of that
prey.

Example: a pred is swallowing two targets, one size 100 and one size 200. The
swallow check fails against the 100 but succeeds against the 200. The total
swallowed size will be reduced by 100/(100 + 200) = 33.33...%.

What is the swallow size based on? I don't know yet.

I'll need to make sure to have a "turns to swallow" indicator so players don't
constantly have to be doing math.

Swallows might be automatic, to save mental energy. It keeps repeating your last
action, spit or swallow.
