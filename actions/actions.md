# Actions

Every action has a type: Action, Quick Action, Free Action, or Internal Action.

Once every round, a character may perform one action and one quick action, or
two quick actions. They may also perform one internal action and any number of
free actions.

An action may also have tags applied to it. Below are the definitions of these
tags - if an

## Destablizing

When using a destablizing action against a target, on a failure, do poise damage
equal to your roll, reduced by the defender's degree of success. On a success,
do poise damage equal to your roll plus your degree of success. This effect
happens before and in addition to the failure or success results of the action.
If this poise damage causes a target to be staggered, actions which require the
target to be vulnerable are able to succeed, even if they were not staggered
before the action.

If the target of an acton is an organ, indigestion damage is dealt rather than
poise damage.

## Focused

A focused action cannot be used while vulnerable.

# Vulnerability

Some actions require a vulnerable target. A target is considered vulnerable if
they suffer from any status effect that specifies vulnerability, including being
fainted, asleep, staggered, or stunned. For an organ, this requires being upset,
or if the organ's owner is fainted.

If an action is Destablizing and also requires Vulnerability, the Vulnerability
happens second; for example, if a devour attempt staggers a target, they can be
eaten even if they were not staggered before.

# Critical hits

Unless otherwise specified, a contested roll against a vulnerable target is a
critical roll.
