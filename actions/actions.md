# Actions

## Destablizing

Many actions are marked as destablizing (name pending). Regardless of what
skills are used, on a failure, do poise damage equal to your roll, reduced by
the defender's degree of success. On a success, do poise damage equal to your
roll plus your degree of success. This effect happens before and in addition to
the failure or success results of the action. If this poise damage causes a
target to be staggered, actions which require the target to be vulnerable are
able to succeed, even if they were not staggered before the action.

If the target of an acton is an organ, all above rules apply, but indigestion
damage is dealt rather than poise damage.

## Vulnerability

Some actions require a vulnerable target. A target is considered vulnerable if
they suffer from any status effect that specifies vulnerability, including being
incapacitated, asleep, staggered, or stunned. For an organ, this requires being
weakened.

## Critical and Lucky rolls

Unless otherwise specified, a contested roll against a vulnerable target is a
critical roll. When defending against a vulnerable target, your roll is lucky.
Both of these apply to weakened organs.
