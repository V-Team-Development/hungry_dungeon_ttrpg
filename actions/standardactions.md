# Action Types

Many actions are a variation on a standard action type. Below are the types used
by two or more actions:

## Targeted Attack

Roll the specified skill contested by the target's dodge. On a success, do
health damage equal to your skill modifier plus your degree of success. This
health damage is reduced by the defender's endure roll.

If attacking an organ you are inside of, the target uses their body roll to
contest.
