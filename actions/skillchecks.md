# Skill Checks

A skill check will combine the stat totals of a skill and roll a d6 for each of
them. Each 5 or 6 you roll is a success, and if you have enough successes for
the check you pass. In some cases, rolling more successes than you need will
grant bonuses.

## Contested Checks

In a contested check, rather than rolling vs some flat value, you need to have
more successes than your opponent. For example, to attack an enemy, your strike
score (Strength + Agility) needs to have more successes than your target's Dodge
score (Agility + Instinct). On a tie, the defender wins.

As with normal checks, rolling more successes than you need will sometimes grant
bonuses. For an attack, each success over your target is an extra point of
damage.
