# Escape

- Action
- Destablizing

Make a strike roll contested by your pred's body roll. On a success against a
weakened organ, begin escaping from that organ. If already escaping, or while
being swallowed, move yourself out of the organ by an amount equal to the
opening size of the orifice you are moving through. If your roll exceeds twice
the pred's roll, move twice.

If moving into another organ, rather than outside of the pred, your current
organ does not need to be weakened.
