# Wild Flurry

- Action
- Destablizing
- Cost: 10 energy

A reckless series of attacks, gaining in strength each strike while leaving you
vulnerable. Make a [Targeted Attack](../standardactions.md#targeted-attack)
using your [Strike](../../unsorted/skills.md#strike) skill, while gaining 1
stack of the Wild Flurry effect. Each stack decreases your dodge modifier by 2,
while adding 2 to the damage of the next wild flurry. This effect expires in two
turns, refreshing the duration every time a stack is gained.
