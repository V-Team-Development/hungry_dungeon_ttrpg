# Swallow

- Action
- Cost: 10 energy

While devouring a target, make a body roll, contested by your prey's body roll.
On a success, swallow your prey by an amount equal to the opening size of the
orifice the prey is being swallowed by. If your roll exceeds twice the prey's
roll, swallow twice.

You may also reverse this, spitting out partially-swallowed prey. Enemies will
usually not contest this roll.
