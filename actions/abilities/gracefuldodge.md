# Graceful Dodge

- Free Action

Use this skill to begin using Graceful Dodge. While Graceful Dodge is active,
any [Targeted Attack](../standardactions.md#targeted-attack) that would hit you
has its roll reduced by 1 at the cost of 4 poise. This activates multiple times
until the attack is no longer able to hit or you run out of poise. Running out
of poise will stagger you, even if the attack does not hit. At any time, you may
deactivate this skill.
