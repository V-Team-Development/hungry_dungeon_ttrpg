# Move Prey

- Internal Action

Move prey from one of your organs, either to another connected organ or outside
of you. Make a body roll contested by your target's body roll. On a success,
move your prey by an amount equal to the opening size of the orifice the prey is
being moved from. If your roll exceeds twice the prey's roll, move twice.
