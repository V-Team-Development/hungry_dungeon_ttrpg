# The Hungry Dungeon TTRPG

Hungry Dungeon is a vore rpg which has gone through several iterations and
codebases. Over time, new features have been added, increasing the complexity
and disturbing the game balance, leaving residue of old design littering the
codebase. To aid in the transition to 4.0, this intermediate step is being
developed, a faux tabletop RPG rulebook not intended to be used by actual
players, but to serve as a reference guide for development.

Please note that this is a multiplayer game, catering to a wide variety of
interests. Almost everything can be toggled off for your character, but only a
few specific things can be disabled (invisible to you) globally. If you are
discomforted by these things happening around you, this experience isn't one
you'll enjoy.
