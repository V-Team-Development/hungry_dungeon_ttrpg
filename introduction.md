# Introduction

Hungry Dungeon is an RPG game where vore is a core mechanic, aiming to be
different from the many games out there where vore is just a victory or game
over condition. Eating enemies, being eaten, escaping, and being escaped from
are all critical to the gameplay. There are multiple forms of vore, as well as
vore-adjacent fetishes, though few of these are required. Options exist to
disable some mechanics, such as preventing your character from being eaten, but
you will still be exposed to them. If you have a low tolerance for things you
aren't into, this game may not be suited for you.
